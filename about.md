title: My name is Joffrey and I <3 development 
---

My name is Joffrey Kern, I'm live in Strasbourg, France and working for Euro Information Developement on a project called LyfPay as .NET Architect. I'm also co-founder of the [Microsoft User Group Strasbourg](https://www.meetup.com/MugStrasbourg/). I'm a [developer](./projects.html) before anything else and I like to share my knowledge with this [blog](./blog) or [conferences](./speaker.html).

The goal of this blog is to motivate myself on working on new technologies and share my opinions on it. I'm blogging with the language of Shakespeare to improve my English, this is not my mother tongue. About the content, if you find a bad sentence, grammatical fault or anything is not "good English", feel [free to tell me what is wrong and why](https://github.com/joffreykern/joffreykern.github.io/issues). My blog is opensource and everyone is welcome to improve its content!

This is the third blog that I started, I hope it'll be the last one...

You can found more informations about me in my StackoverFlow [Developer Story](https://stackoverflow.com/users/story/1268670?view=Cv) and follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Jo_Kern).

**One more thing : This blog, its content and opinions are my own.**
