#### Table of Content Generator for VSCode

TOC Generator is a VSCode plugin built in TypeScript, you can download it [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=joffreykern.markdown-toc).

I'm not so proud of the code because it is not unit tested and it doesn't respect any code conventions, but it's doing the job and I use it everyday on my work.

The code is available on [Github](https://github.com/joffreykern/vscode-markdown-toc). 

#### Smartbourg, an Windows Phone 8 Application

I built this project with a friend Gilles Humez for a contest. It was an interesting project because we had to create this application in one weekend by using opendata of our city : Strasbourg. I was in charge of the development and Gilles was the designer.

The code is available on [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/joffreykern/strasbourg/).
